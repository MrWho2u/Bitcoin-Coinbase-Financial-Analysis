# Background
This Challenge, takes the role of an analyst at a high-tech investment firm. The vice president (VP) of your department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?

This code sorts through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. It then determines if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

# What Been Created
The code performs the following phases of financial analysis:

+ Collects CSV data in a Jupyter notebook file.
+ Prepares the datasets for analysis by cleaning missing and erroneous data.
+ Analyzes the data at a high level through summary statistics and visualizations, and use this information to select areas for deeper analysis. Specifically, time periods in which to identify arbitrage opportunities.
